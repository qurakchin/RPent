"""Wire contracts shared by robot integrations and action-model capabilities.

These values describe a robot's native action layout and camera roles. They
live beside the components layer rather than in ``robots/`` because model
adapters consume them too; a capability may not import a robot integration.
Robot modules re-export the values they own so existing call sites keep a
single import path.
